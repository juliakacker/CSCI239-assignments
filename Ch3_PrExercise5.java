/* The manager of a football stadium wants you to write a program that calculates the total ticket sales after each game. There are four types of ticketsâ€”box, sideline, premium, and general admission. After each game, data is stored in a file in the following form:
ticketPrice numberOfTicketsSold

Sample data are shown below: 
250 5750
100 28000
50 35750
25 18750

The first line indicates that the box ticket price is $250 and that 5750 tickets were sold at that price. Output the number of tickets sold and the total sale amount. Format your output with two decimal places. */
